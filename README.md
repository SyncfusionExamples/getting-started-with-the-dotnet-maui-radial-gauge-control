# Getting Started with the .NET MAUI Radial Gauge Control

The [.NET MAUI Radial Gauge](https://www.syncfusion.com/maui-controls/maui-radial-gauge?utm_source=github&utm_medium=listing&utm_campaign=maui-radial-gauge-github-samples) is a multipurpose data visualization control that displays numerical values on a circular scale. This article shows how to create and configure the Syncfusion .NET MAUI Radial Gauge. This project also includes a code snippet to set a specific axis pointer value, customize the gauge axis as well as how to animate the gauge, animate the pointer, and add multiple axis ranges.Â 


## Project pre-requisites

Make sure that you have the compatible versions of Visual Studio with .NET MAUI workloads and .NET SDK version in your machine before starting to work on this project.

## How to run this application?

To run this application, you need to first clone the getting-started-with-the-dotnet-maui-radial-gauge-control repository and then open it in Visual Studio 2022. Now, simply build and run your project to view the output.

## Features and Benefits

### Ranges
Radial range is a visual element that helps to quickly visualize a value where it falls on the axis.

### Pointers 
Pointer is used to indicate values on an axis. Radial gauge has three types of pointers: needle pointer, shape pointer, content pointer and range pointer. All the pointers can be customized as needed.

### Pointer animation 
Animates the pointer in a visually appealing way when the pointer moves from one value to another.

### Pointer interaction
Radial gauge provides an option to drag a pointer from one value to another. It is used to change the value at run time.

### Annotations
Add multiple views such as text and image as an annotation to a specific point of interest in a radial gauge.
